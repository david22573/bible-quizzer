It reminds us that true greatness is found in humility and obedience to God, rather than in worldly power and success. It also challenges us to examine our own motives and desires, and to seek God's glory rather than our own."

It also shows the fulfillment of God's command to fill the earth and the diversity of cultures and languages that resulted from the confusion at Babel. This relates to the overall message of the Bible, which is the story of God's redemptive plan for all nations through the coming of Jesus Christ, who reconciles all people to God and to one another."

It also foreshadows the Great Commission, in which Jesus commands His followers to make disciples of all nations (Matthew 28:18-20).
